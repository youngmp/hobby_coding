# hobby_coding

A reposity for scripts I write for fun or for research that I think would benefit others.

These scripts are not particularly optimal. I can virtually guarantee that faster and cleaner code exists elsewhere, but sometimes a quick and dirty implementation is needed. In this repository you will find the slowest and dirtiest code on the internet.
